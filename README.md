One real, public TESS SPOC light curve; one saved NASA Exoplanet Archive
ephemeris; one reproducible flat-versus-box statistical comparison.

## Data sources

- **System parameters** — the saved `pscomppars` row from the [NASA Exoplanet Archive TAP service](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/TAP/sync?query=select+pl_name%2Chostname%2Cra%2Cdec%2Cpl_orbper%2Cpl_tranmid%2Cpl_trandur%2Cpl_rade%2Cpl_bmasse%2Cpl_eqt%2Cpl_orbsmax%2Csy_dist%2Csy_tmag%2Cst_teff%2Cst_rad%2Cst_mass%2Cdisc_year%2Cdiscoverymethod%2Cdisc_refname%2Cdisc_pubdate%2Cdisc_facility+from+pscomppars+where+pl_name%3D%27WASP-69+b%27&format=csv).
- **Observed photometry** — unmodified MAST file `tess2022217014003-s0055-0000000248853232-0242-s_lc.fits`, TESS Sector 55, DOI [10.17909/t9-nmc8-f686](https://doi.org/10.17909/t9-nmc8-f686). This is a real SPOC reduced light curve, not simulated data.
- Exact URLs, IDs, retrieval date, and SHA-256 checksum are in [`data/SOURCE.md`](data/SOURCE.md).

## Reproduce the analysis

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/analyze_transit.py
python scripts/analyze_multisector.py
pytest tests/ -v
```

The script keeps finite `QUALITY == 0` cadences, normalizes `PDCSAP_FLUX`,
applies one symmetric robust outlier rule, and examines ±2.5 published transit
durations around the fixed NASA ephemeris. It compares a weighted constant with
a two-level box whose depth is fitted. Timing and duration are not searched.

## What the numbers show

| Quantity | Result |
|---|---:|
| TESS sector | 55 |
| Cadences in comparison | 1311 |
| Fitted box depth | 12462.6 ± 38.6 ppm |
| Flat χ² / dof / p | 134039.42 / 1310 / < 1e-300 |
| Box χ² / dof / p | 29790.20 / 1309 / < 1e-300 |
| Improvement Δχ² / Δdof / p | 104249.22 / 1 / < 1e-300 |

The fixed-window box improves strongly on a flat light curve for these data. This establishes only how these archived fluxes compare with this
pre-specified box model. It does not independently confirm the planet or identify
an atmosphere.

## Multi-sector robustness and correlated noise

The fixed archive ephemeris was fitted independently in 1 usable sector(s) (S55). Formal depth errors were inflated by sqrt(max(reduced chi-square, 1)) times the residual time-averaging beta factor (observed range 3.39-3.39). The robust inverse-variance depth is 12462.6 +/- 624.9 ppm; a sector-to-sector Q test requires at least two usable sectors. These scaled errors address underestimated scatter and short-timescale correlation, but they are not a full Gaussian-process or physical limb-darkened transit fit.

## System context

- Radius: 11.21 Earth radii
- Mass: 82.58 Earth masses
- Orbital period: 3.868139 days
- Transit duration: 2.187 hours
- Semi-major axis: 0.0453 AU
- Equilibrium temperature: 971 K
- Host: WASP-69 · distance 49.96 pc
- Discovery: 2014 by Transit (SuperWASP)

## Limitations

- A box is not a limb-darkened physical transit model and does not retrieve radius ratio, impact parameter, or stellar density.
- Period, mid-transit epoch, and duration are fixed to one NASA composite row; their uncertainties and transit-timing variations are not propagated.
- SPOC PDCSAP processing, crowding corrections, stellar variability, time-correlated noise, and underestimated point uncertainties can make absolute χ² p-values poor even when the relative comparison is informative.
- The χ² improvement uses one additional fitted depth parameter and no timing search. It is not a blind detection false-alarm probability, and nearby-star contamination is not ruled out.
- Published global fits combine sectors, instruments, detrending choices, limb darkening, and astrophysical priors. This deliberately smaller test does not replace them.
