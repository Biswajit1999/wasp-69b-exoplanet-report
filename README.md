One real public TESS SPOC light curve; one historical NASA Exoplanet Archive ephemeris; one timing-adjusted, limb-darkened transit fit.

## Data sources

- **System parameters** — the saved `pscomppars` row from the [NASA Exoplanet Archive TAP service](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/TAP/sync?query=select+pl_name%2Chostname%2Cra%2Cdec%2Cpl_orbper%2Cpl_tranmid%2Cpl_trandur%2Cpl_rade%2Cpl_bmasse%2Cpl_eqt%2Cpl_orbsmax%2Csy_dist%2Csy_tmag%2Cst_teff%2Cst_rad%2Cst_mass%2Cdisc_year%2Cdiscoverymethod%2Cdisc_refname%2Cdisc_pubdate%2Cdisc_facility+from+pscomppars+where+pl_name%3D%27WASP-69+b%27&format=csv).
- **Observed photometry** — unmodified MAST file `tess2022217014003-s0055-0000000248853232-0242-s_lc.fits`, TESS Sector 55, DOI [10.17909/t9-nmc8-f686](https://doi.org/10.17909/t9-nmc8-f686). This is a real SPOC reduced light curve, not simulated data.
- Exact URLs, IDs, retrieval date, and SHA-256 checksum are in [`data/SOURCE.md`](data/SOURCE.md).

## Reproduce the analysis

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/analyze_transit.py
python scripts/analyze_multisector.py
pytest tests/ -v
```

The script keeps finite `QUALITY == 0` cadences, normalizes `PDCSAP_FLUX`, and applies one symmetric robust outlier rule. A local linear null is compared with a circular quadratic-limb-darkened transit. The archive period and predicted phase are retained, while midpoint, radius ratio, impact parameter, baseline, and baseline slope are fitted inside a bounded window. The limb-darkening coefficients and scaled semi-major axis are fixed and disclosed in the CSV.

## What the corrected fit shows

| Quantity | Result |
|---|---:|
| TESS sector | 55 |
| Cadences in fitted window | 1573 |
| Transit support | ΔBIC ≥ 10 |
| Midpoint correction | -0.002 h ± 0.15 min |
| Model mid-transit depth | 17223.7 ± 80.6 ppm |
| Radius ratio Rp/Rs | 0.12824 |
| Fitted / published duration | 2.178 / 2.187 h |
| Linear null χ² / dof / BIC | 138888.35 / 1571 / 138903.07 |
| Transit χ² / dof / BIC | 3941.46 / 1568 / 3978.26 |
| ΔBIC (null − transit) | 134924.81 |

The timing-adjusted transit is strongly preferred by ΔBIC = 134924.8. Its fitted midpoint is -0.002 hours from the historical prediction; the model's mid-transit depth is 17223.7 ± 80.6 ppm. A fitted timing correction can diagnose ephemeris drift, but this single-sector fit is not a replacement for a global transit-timing analysis.

<!-- MULTISECTOR-UPGRADE-START -->
## Multi-sector robustness and correlated noise

The archive prediction was timing-adjusted independently in 1 fitted sector(s) (S55), of which 1 meet Delta BIC >= 10. Formal depth errors were inflated by sqrt(max(reduced chi-square, 1)) times the residual time-averaging beta factor (observed range 4.11-4.11). The robust inverse-variance model depth across supported sectors is 17223.7 +/- 330.9 ppm; a sector-to-sector Q test requires at least two supported sectors. These scaled errors address underestimated scatter and short-timescale correlation, but they are not a full Gaussian-process or physical limb-darkened transit fit.

## System context

- Radius: 11.21 Earth radii
- Mass: 82.58 Earth masses
- Orbital period: 3.868139 days
- Transit duration: 2.187 hours
- Semi-major axis: 0.0453 AU
- Equilibrium temperature: 971 K
- Host: WASP-69 · distance 49.96 pc
- Discovery: 2014 by Transit (SuperWASP)

## Limitations

- The orbit is assumed circular and the quadratic limb-darkening coefficients are fixed representative values; they are not atmosphere-grid interpolations.
- The scaled semi-major axis is derived from the saved composite semi-major axis and stellar radius; their uncertainties are not propagated.
- Midpoint freedom corrects accumulated ephemeris error but introduces a bounded timing search. ΔBIC, not a naïve one-parameter p-value, is used as the support gate.
- PDCSAP processing, dilution, stellar variability, transit-timing variations, and long-timescale covariance can still bias the inferred geometry.
- Radius ratio, impact parameter, and fixed limb darkening are correlated. Published global fits with physical priors and simultaneous detrending remain authoritative.
